# Welcome.

So, the first task is completed, you launched the project. Congratulations!

For a systematic review of what's going on with the frontend in be7team, <nuxt-link to="/docs">go to the README</nuxt-link>.
On this page and on those that you will create later, you can try what you read about: components, i18n, styles, themes, and whatever you find.

And yes, feel free to text <a href="https://t.me/pyncz" target="_blank">me</a> if you have any questions (it would be strange if you didn't).

If you have already made your way through the <nuxt-link to="/docs">README</nuxt-link> or you are a Schopenhauer fan and only admit cognition through suffering, let's move on.

Below on this page is an example of working with the <nuxt-link to="/docs#arch">front architecture</nuxt-link> (in particular, store and services). This uses the API dev server of our NFT marketplace <a href="https://app.picipo.io" target="_blank">Picipo</a>. You can view the API documentation <a href="https://app.picipo.io/swagger" target="_blank">here</a>.

A good decision would probably be to go into the code now and see how everything works. And the plan for the further adventure is something like this:

- Check the components, add some element to the card. Let's say, the collection preview component will be just fine.
- Dive into the models, services and store. Look into the swagger and extend the Item models.
- Create a new route for the collection list overview.
- Create a route to receive and view a specific collection.
- Find the entity you like in the swagger and try to create models/services/store and a page for servicing it from scratch.

Good luck and welcome to the code!
